//comment : Consider an example where there’s an account holder table where we are 
doing an intra bank transfer i.e. a person holding account A is trying to 
transfer $100 to account B.  - - 
for this you have to make a transaction in sql which can 
transfer fund from account A to B  
Make sure after the transaction the account information 
have to be updated for both the credit account and the 
debited account//

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct $100 from Account 124
UPDATE Account_Holder
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_no = 124;

-- Add $100 to Account 456
UPDATE Account_Holder
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_no = 456;
```

//comment Also fetch the details of the account holder who are related from the same 
city  //


```sql
SELECT *
FROM Account_Holder
WHERE city = "baroda";
```
![](ss2\Screenshot_2024-10-08_225455.png)

//Write a query to fetch account number and account holder name, whose 
accounts were created after 15th of any month 
//


```sql
SELECT account_no, account_holder_name,date_of_account_created
FROM Account_Holder
WHERE date_of_account_created = '2023-01-15';
```

//Write a query to display the city name and count the branches in that city. 
Give the count of branches an alias name of Count_Branch. //


```sql
SELECT branch_city, COUNT(branch_id) AS alias
FROM Bank
GROUP BY branch_city;
```

//Write a query to display the city name and count the branches in that city. 
Give the count of branches an alias name of Count_Branch. //

//Write a query to display the account holder’s id, account holder’s name, 
branch id, and loan amount for people who have taken loans. (NOTE : use 
sql  join concept to solve the query)
//
```sql
SELECT 
    a.account_holder_id, 
    a.account_holder_name, 
    l.branch_id, 
    l.loan_amount
